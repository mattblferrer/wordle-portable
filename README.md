This is a portable Wordle application written in the Arduino programming language.
- Contains the official Wordle list of valid words.
- Built to fit the memory limit of common ESP32 boards and may not be compatible with most Arduino Uno / Nano boards.
  
Built as a requirement for my Microprocessors and Microcontrollers class.
